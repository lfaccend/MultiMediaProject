	<p style="text-align: justify;  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:black;"> Rock & Roll, just hearing the words spawns an image of recklessnness, rebellion, and mayhem. But beyond the sex and the drugs Rock music has had an imense impact
	on culture and the evolution of music. There is debate to exactly when Rock & Roll music originated but there is no doubt that it became increasingly more popular throughout
	the 1960s and 1970s. This webpage offers some insight into the culture and musical landscape of the 1960s-1970s showing just how influential Rock & Roll was as well as
	the bands that made it possible.</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify;  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> The 1960s had a significant shift in culture from the 1950s. As healing from WWII continued the Cold War between the United States and Russia began to heat up. 
				The United States also dealt with the Vietnam war, the Civil Rights movement, and student protests throughout the country. By the 1960s the U.S. had been in the
				Vietnam War for half a decade. Tensions rose as thousands of lives were lost. The Civil Rights movement was also taking place in the U.S. at the time. Martin Luther
				King marched on Washington in 1963 and in 1964 the Civil Rights Act was signed ensuring equal employment for all and the integration of all public facilities. The inequality
				and repression of different groups lead to student marches throughout the U.S. demanding equality and the end of nuclear weapons.
				With so much turmoil came expression through music. An almost counter culture was established that opposed the views of the older generations and Rock & Roll embodied
				that culture. From something as simple as growing long hair to the experimentation of psychadelic drugs Rock & Roll bands spearheaded a rebellious, expressive
				generation.</p>

					Elvis Presley may be considered the King of Rock & Roll but it only became more popular as time went on. 
					Studios were flooding with new technology and the experimentation with these new instraments and equipment Gave Rock & Roll a new sound. 
					It was faster, louder, had more explicit lyrics, and to top it all off it was everywhere. Radio stations and televisions had mainstreamed the media and those
